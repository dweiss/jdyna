		<h1>JDyna.com</h1>
		<p>This is a Java clone of the classic Dyna Blaster (Bomberman) game by Hudson Soft.        
        This software was created for fun and out of nostalgia only. It is not meant  to
        be sold  or redistributed  in any  way other  than for  playing with  a bunch of
        friends at the office (during lunch breaks of course).</p>

        <h1>Required software</h1>
        <p>JDyna requires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">Java Web Start</a>
        technology (Java 1.6). Download Java <a href="http://java.com/en/">from here</a> if you 
        don't have it.</p>

        <p><a href="play"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Launch JDyna!
        (version @VERSION@, published: @BUILD.TSTAMP@).
        </span></a></p>

        <h1>Supported game modes and help</h1>
        <p><img class="right" src="img/launcher.png" />JDyna sports the following game modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Local, two-players mode.</b>
            Play against your friend using the same keyboard.
            Controller for player A: cursor keys and CTRL (bomb drop).
            Controller for player B: DFGR keys (move) and Z (bomb drop).</li>
           
            <li><b>Local, player-computer mode.</b> Play against one of several
            computer artificial intelligence algorithms. Their actual
            intelligence ranges from smart to practically infallible. If you can
            win against tyson, you must be a robot or something.</li>
            
            <li><b>Network (LAN) games.</b> Play together with your friends over a local
            area network. The actual competition can involve individuals or entire teams
            of players. Fun, fun, fun.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Network mode does not work.</b> Check your firewalls. JDyna uses
            UDP broadcasts on ports 50000, 50001 and TCP connections to the
	    "server" on port 50000.</li>

            <li><b>Does it work on Linux/ MacOS/ Windows?</b> Yes, in the current
            implementation everything should work on compatible Java virtual machines. The
            performance of Java2D (drawing) engine may vary from platform to platform though.</li>

            <li><b>Sound does not work.</b> Java Sound API is somewhat crippled and uses hardware audio
	    devices on certain platforms (it does not use high-level mixers like ALSA). You can try to switch to
	    OpenAL using the preferences button (this is the default setting anyway).</li>

            <li><b>Where is the source code?</b> Unfortunately we cannot release source
            code to JDyna at this moment. If you're interested in development, however,
            feel free to get in touch.</li>

            <li><b>Our boss/admin/colleague does not let me play.</b> Peer involvement
            is strongly encouraged and advised.</li>

            <li><b>Bots are too smart, I can't win.</b> Practice harder.</li>
        </ul>
