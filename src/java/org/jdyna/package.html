		<h1>Dyna Blaster</h1>
		
		<p>This package contains (limited) Dyna Blaster reimplementation in Java. We strived for
		consistency with original Dyna, although certain things might work a bit different
		than in the original.</p>

		<p>The reimplementation is limited to tournament (battle) mode only. No single-player
		mode is implemented.</p>
		
		<p>Note that copyrights for the graphical files and resources may (and probably still do)
		hold, so this code is <b>for internal use only, please do not publish or
		redistribute.</b></p>
