Running the game, understanding the code
----------------------------------------

For remote mode, Corba is used. There are shells scripts that launch the
server, attach players to the server and start a game for players registered
on the server. All these can be launched on a single machine of course.

dyna server                -h localhost -p 50000 
dyna client --name player1 -h localhost -p 50000 
dyna client --name player2 -h localhost -p 50000 
dyna game                  -h localhost -p 50000

All these programs have additional iiop.host and iiop.port options that fix
Corba traffic to a given port/ network interface. They are useful with 
firewalls and NAT.

Look at the shell scripts for main classes starting each network component,
they should be fairly easy to understand (with minor exceptions).
