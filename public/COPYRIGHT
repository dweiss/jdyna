All the graphics in the "classic" image set comes from an old DOS
version of Dyna Blaster. I believe this graphics is still under
copyrights, so PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE.

The rest of the code was written from scratch, only by looking at
the behavior of the original Dyna Blaster version, but it is NOT
INTENDED FOR REPUBLISHING IN ANY FORM. The ONLY purpose of this
code is to help you with the homework.
