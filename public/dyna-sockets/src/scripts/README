ALL COMMAND HAVE SUB-OPTIONS, for example "jdyna server" will list the available options for
the server.

	jdyna server

- Launching a "human" (keyboard-controlled) client, creating a new game room. 

	jdyna human -n MY_NAME -g GAMEROOM_NAME -b BOARD_NAME

	jdyna admin games


- Starting a "bot" (class implementing IPlayerFactory). Your code must be packaged in a JAR
  file named "player.jar" or exist in CLASSPATH variable already.

	jdyna bot CLASS_NAME

  where CLASS_NAME is your fully qualified bot's class name.

  There are sub-options that may be of use, for example:

	jdyna bot --no-view --no-sound CLASS_NAME
	 
  will start the bot without the local view and without a sound (so that the player may utilize more
  local resources).
