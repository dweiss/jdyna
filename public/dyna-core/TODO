GENERAL/ STARTUP SCREEN

-   Improve (suggest changes, implement them) the multi player server mode. How should games and
   	players be managed? When does a new game start and who initiates a game? Think of multiple
	environments -- cell phones, applets, WebStart. The mechanism should apply to all.

-   Add configuration screen to keyboard layouts.

-   All kinds of minor GUI tweaks: configuration of sound/views, configuration of default player names.

EVENTS/ NETWORKING

- 	Delta-compression of network data sent between frames. 
    With changes for existing networking implementations.

- 	Multicast or broadcast (datagram?) networking implementation.

SOUND

- 	Add a sound player view based on  lwjgl.org.

-   There is something screwy in javax.audio (how many mixed samples can be replayed
    at once?). Would interrupt-and-replay work better?

VIEW

-   Implement jMonkeyEngine-based OpenGL view.

MISC

-   Clean up test code, launchers and other things that have grown on the code.

- 	Visual editor for game boards :]

- 	J2ME view implementation. Bluetooth, internet, ad-hoc gaming modes.

- 	Eclipse view implementation (plugin :).
