/**
 * <p>

 * <p>
 * All events should implement {@link Serializable} interface so that they can be written
 * and read from binary streams. The following things are of importance:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a unique <code>serialVersionUID</code> is not really required since serialization
 * will take place at runtime and will not be persisted between game versions with major
 * changes in the serialization API. That said, it may be a problem to exchange serialized
 * data between different VMs if the automatically generated serial UID is different. This
 * will have to be investigated experimentally. I set a custom UID for now. See
 * {@link #serialVersionUID} for more info.</li>
 * <li>strive for performance, if possible. Serializing simple fields is probably easy,
 * but serialization of complex data structures should be done by hand.</li>
 * <li>if the serialization costs are still to large, we may have to switch to entirely
 * hand-written serialization code. This is a last-resort option, of course.</li>
 * </ul>
