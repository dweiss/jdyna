NEXT: I17

## Improvement and patch suggestions:

GENERAL/ STARTUP SCREEN

I2	Improve (suggest changes, implement them) the multi player server mode. How should games and
   	players be managed? When does a new game start and who initiates a game? Think of multiple
	environments -- cell phones, applets, WebStart. The mechanism should apply to all.
	
I15 Code up a startup screen with options to launch a local game between an arbitrary (2-4?)
    number of players. Select opponents between various CPU players and human players.
    Add configuration screen to keyboard layouts.
    Launch a game server, show connected players
    and start new games with these players. Connect to another game server and allow
    a given user to play against remote opponents.

EVENTS/ NETWORKING

I4	Delta-compression of network data sent between frames. 
    With changes for existing networking implementations.

I5	Multicast or broadcast (datagram?) networking implementation.

SOUND

I3	Add a sound player view based on  lwjgl.org.

I14 There is something screwy in javax.audio (how many mixed samples can be replayed
    at once?). Would interrupt-and-replay work better?

VIEW

I1	Implement jMonkeyEngine-based OpenGL view.
    
GAMEPLAY
    
I12 Multi-player mode with reincarnating players and 'frag' counters. 

I10	Intelligent opponents and bots. [TWO'2008 homework.]

MISC

I9	Visual editor for game boards :]

I6	J2ME view implementation. Bluetooth, internet, ad-hoc gaming modes.


## DONE

[DONE] I16 Add game recording listener/ replay mode for recorded games. [dep. on I13]
[DONE] I13 Event packet serialization and packet streams.

[DONE] I11  Rethink event passing, filtering and serialization. [DW; add serialization and I5?]

[DONE] I7	Bonuses (bomb increase, range increase).

[DONE] I8	Add different (than classic) gameboard definitions. This can (should?) include an 
    alternative reader for board definitions so that, for example, a name can be given to 
    the board...
