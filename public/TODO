Improvement and patch suggestions:

I11 Rethink event passing, filtering and serialization. [DW]

I10	Intelligent opponents and bots. [TWO'2008 homework.]

I9	Visual editor for game boards :]

I8	Add different (than classic) gameboard definitions. This can (should?) include an alternative reader
	for board definitions so that, for example, a name can be given to the board... 

I7	Bonuses (bomb increase, range increase).

I6	J2ME view implementation. Bluetooth, internet, ad-hoc gaming modes.

I5	Multicast or broadcast (datagram?) networking implementation.

I4	Delta-compression of network data sent between frames. With changes for existing networking implementations.

I3	Rip and add sounds (jMonkeyEngine or lwjgl.org have support, I think). This should include changes
	to the view protocol to indicate when a sound should be played.

I2	Improve (suggest changes, implement them) the multi player server mode. How should games and
    	players be managed? When does a new game start and who initiates a game? Think of multiple
	environments -- cell phones, applets, WebStart. The mechanism should apply to all.

I1	Implement jMonkeyEngine-based OpenGL view.
