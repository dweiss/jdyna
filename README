
JDYNA
=====

A nostalgic reimplementation of the once-famous Dyna Blaster (aka Bomberman) in Java.


Goals of the project
--------------------

- close to identical simulation of behavior (gfx, sounds, movements) compared to Dyna Blaster,
- ability to play with a number of opponents on the local network,
- ability to play against an AI bot.


License and Copyright
---------------------

The code is GPLed. We ripped the graphics and sounds from an (owned) copy of Dyna Blaster 
and we hope by now it is considered "abandonware". We mean no harm, but want to revive old
memories of this fantastic game.


Branches
--------

master   - this is the "classic" version

3d       - this is a branch with 3D-enabled and much improved version (additional bonuses, 
           status panel, etc.). Unfortunately this branch is no longer actively maintained
           (but if you do fix it, contribute back).
